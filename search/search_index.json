Insert current item in A[i + 1] Pseudocode Pursue clean and concise 1 for j = 2 to A.length 2 key = A[j] 3 // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j - 1] 4 i = j - 1 5 while i > 0 and A[i] > key 6 A[i + 1] = A[i] 7 i = i - 1 8 A[i + 1] = key Tip - Use \"i\" as a important loop variable name. - Use simple condition first when there is logical concatenation. - Use left as variable and right as almost constant value when compare two numbers. - Make it simple as possible Argue that it is correctly works Guess I will use loop invariants. It keeps from start to terminate. I'll claim sub-array is always sorted. loop invariants: The sub-array A[1..j-1] consists of the elements originally in A[1..j-1], but in sorted order. It is similarity to the mathematical induction. We say an algorithm has true loop invariant on some properties. When the three properties hold, the loop invariant is true. 0. Initialization: It is true prior to the first iteration of the loop. 0. Maintenance: If it is true before an iteration of the loop,it remains true before the next iteration. 0. Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant gives us a useful property that helps show that the algorithm is correct. Initialization When j = 2, The subarray A[1..j-1] consists of just one element A[1], which is in fact the original element in A[1]. Moreover, the subarray is sorted(trivially, of course). Maintenance The body of for loop works by moving A[j-1], A[j-2], A[j-3], and so on by one position to the right until it finds the proper position for A j , at which point it inserts the value of a j . The subarray A[1..j] then consists of the elements originally in A[1..j],but it sorted order. Incrementing j for the next iteration of the for loop then preserve the loop invariant. Termination The condition causing the for loop to terminate is that j > A.length = n. Because each loop iteration increase j by 1, we must have j = n + 1 at that time. Substituting n + 1 for j in the wording of loop invariant, we have that the subarray A[1..n] consists of the element originally in A[1..n], but in sorted order. Pseudocode conventions We use the keyword to when a for loop increments its loop counter. We use the keyword downto when a for loop decrements its loop counter. When the loop counter changes by an amount greater then 1, the amount of change follows the optional keyword by. We shall not use global variables without explicit indication. The notation .. is used to indicate a range of values within an arrary. Thus, A[1..j] indicates the subarray of A consisting of the j elements A[1],A[2],...,A[j]. We organize compound date into objects, which are composed of attributes. We treat a variable represent arrary and object as a point to the date representing the arrary or object. For all attributes f of an object x, setting y = x causes y.f to equal x.f. Moreover, if we now set x.f = 3, then afterward not only dose x.f equal 3, but y.f equals 3 as well. In other words, x and y point to same object after the assignment y = x.
